## Task 3: Programming

**Date and Time:** Wednesday 15th January 2020, 9:45am â€“ 1:20pm

**Weighting:** 40%

**CAPRI Learning Objective:** P1: Practical and Organisational Skills (practical skills)

### Task Description:

Open the file [blynk_data.txt](blynk_data.txt) and update it with your blynk token and the following server information. Make sure this information is inside quote marks:
 - Server: iot.nortcele.win
 - Port: 8080

Rename the file as blynk_data.json 

Open the file [\_\_main\_\_.py](__main__.py) and follow the instructions in the internal comments to write your own instructions to control the motors on your device and read data from the sensors.

Test your code on your device. Make sure all the sensors are correctly connected and the device has power.

Draw a [system flow chart](https://www.programiz.com/article/flowchart-programming) to design the path your device will follow and implement this in code. You will use this flow chart as part of your presentation.

**Extension task:** Once you are familiar with the basic commands to move your device utilising feedback from the sensors, expand the file [controller.py](idl_controller/controller.py) to give your python code access to other inputs and outputs on your device.
